1. Project Overview
This project introduces a highly effective deep learning framework designed to address the critical challenges of counterfeiting, model confusion, and subpar products within the Lithium-Ion Battery (LIB) supply chain and consumer market.

By analyzing short-term electrochemical signals, the framework achieves high-accuracy, non-destructive architecture and model identification, serving as a reliable security and verification tool for both industry and end-users.

 2. Key Features
High-Accuracy Certification: Achieves extremely high classification accuracy across multiple authentication tasks using a proprietary deep learning model.

Non-Destructive Testing: Relies only on short-term dynamic electrochemical features (DCA and EIS data), causing no physical damage to the battery cell.

High Robustness: The model has been rigorously validated on 17 publicly available DCA and EIS datasets, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities.

Wide Applicability: Suitable for large-scale, batch-level battery certification as well as instant, consumer-side verification.
